The main plugin can be found in plugin_arm/plugin1.c. The Makefile should be self explanatary, to use the plugin you need to move to the specified GCC version from the paper. The headers are also comitted in arm/plugin, however, there is no modifications in the headers and the GCC ARM toolchain headers should work as well. Each pass can be enabled and disabled by the respective callback from the main function. The attribute used by the plugin is slightly different from the paper and is less readable and is called "irq_box".
