# M2MON
MMIO based security reference monitor. 

Please see for the paper and working of the monitor: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/khan-arslan

Note: I will be pushing the code in current state soon. The plan is to clean it up so people can use the plugin/monitor with configurable parameters.
I plan to leave the benchmarking code which could be useful for people using the same platform (which is unlikely since the platform is discontinuted, but
will give the idea. Current repo code needs to be cleaned, will be doing it in upcoming days.
